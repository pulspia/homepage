# Background Video Setup

Please place an AI-related background video file named `ai-background.mp4` in this directory.

## Video Requirements:
- **File name**: `ai-background.mp4`
- **Format**: MP4
- **Recommended duration**: 10-30 seconds (will loop)
- **Recommended size**: 1920x1080 or higher
- **Content**: AI/technology related visuals (neural networks, data visualization, futuristic interfaces, etc.)
- **Style**: Subtle, not too distracting, works well with overlay

## Alternative Options:
If you don't have a custom video, you can:

1. **Download free AI/tech videos from**:
   - Pixabay (pixabay.com/videos/)
   - Pexels (pexels.com/videos/)
   - Unsplash (unsplash.com/videos/)

2. **Search terms**:
   - "artificial intelligence"
   - "neural network"
   - "data visualization"
   - "technology background"
   - "abstract tech"

3. **Fallback**: The component will gracefully fallback to the static background if no video is found.

The video will automatically play muted in a loop with reduced opacity to ensure text readability.
